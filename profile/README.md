# C Projects by [@dezashibi](https://github.com/dezashibi) (Navid Dezashibi)

Hey all ðŸ‘‹ This organization is dedicated to showcasing my skills in C programming and serving as an educational resource for those interested in learning C.

## About

I am Navid Dezashibi, a passionate C programmer. This organization contains a collection of my C projects, demonstrating a range of programming concepts, from basic syntax to advanced algorithms and data structures. Each project is well-documented and includes examples and explanations to aid understanding.

**I would be glad to hear your opinions and also cooperate in your company project if you need help, don't hesitate to contact me.**

## Objectives

- **Skill Demonstration**: Highlight my proficiency in C programming through various projects. Also demonstrations of repository management, problem solving, patches, etc by simulating real-life situations. Most of these also have been reflected in the readme files of the repos to show knowledge management and keeping lesson learned materials.
- **Educational Resource**: Provide a comprehensive code base for beginners and enthusiasts to learn and reference.
- **Collaboration**: Encourage contributions and collaboration from other C developers and learners.

### Naming Conventions
When browsing repositories [here](https://github.com/orgs/dezashibi-c-projects/repositories?q=sort%3Aname-asc) you can follow these conventions to understand the category of the repository:
- `b-...` means the portfolio project demonstrates beginner friendly concepts, the goal is to use most aspect of `C` programming as much as possible.
- `i-...` means the portfolio project demonstrates intermediate level of programming, might be a toy project or just code examples, these codes are mostly focused on algorithms.
- `a-...` means the portfolio project is an advanced topic, might be a fully working project or just some code examples.
- `<no prefix>...` projects without prefixes are personal projects and code bases that I might work on for the sake of creativity and my needs.

## Portfolio Projects

### Beginner
  1. **[Hello World](https://github.com/dezashibi-c-projects/b-hello-world)**: Getting started with `C` programming and learn all the basics.
  2. **[Calculator in C](https://github.com/dezashibi-c-projects/b-calculator)**: A cli based calulator with ability to load data from file.

### Intermediate
  1. **[Prime Number and Palindrome String Checker](https://github.com/dezashibi-c-projects/i-prpal_tool)**: checks if a given string is a palindrome then if the string is also an integer number will checks if the given number is a prime number, too.
  2. **[Matrix Multiplication](https://github.com/dezashibi-c-projects/i-matrices_mult)**: reads matrices data from the given file and prints the result of multiplying them after checking the multiplication possibility.
  3. **[Task Manager (todo list) using Linked List](https://github.com/dezashibi-c-projects/i-task_manager)**: This application will manage a list of tasks, allowing users to add, remove, display, save, and load tasks from a file.
  4. **[Conway's Game of Life in `C`](https://github.com/dezashibi-c-projects/i-game_of_life)**: It is designed to be as simple as it can and works on Windows and Linux/Mac without problem.

### Advanced
  1. **[Directory Search](https://github.com/dezashibi-c-projects/a-directory_search)**: Using Multi-threading and directory traversing in a cross platform way, using third party libraries, yes or no.
  2. **[Portable Binary File Serialization in C: Ensuring Cross-Platform Data Integrity](https://github.com/dezashibi-c-projects/a-writing_portable_binary)**: A simple guide and example code for creating portable binary files in C, addressing architecture-specific challenges like endianness and data alignment.
  3. **[Understanding SIMD: A Boost for C Programs](https://github.com/dezashibi-c-projects/a-simd_in_c)**: Brief description of what this project entails.
  4. **[Producer/Consumer vs. Publisher/Subscriber in C](https://github.com/dezashibi-c-projects/a-prod_cons_vs_pub_sub_in_c)**: An examination of the producer-consumer and publish-subscribe patterns, their implementations using in C, and their key differences and applications.
  5. **[Lexical Analysis in C with Graphs and Matrices](https://github.com/dezashibi-c-projects/a-graph_matrix_simplified)**: Using graphs and adjacency matrices in C programming to efficiently implement finite state machines for lexical analysis and parsing.

## Personal Projects and Libraries

  1. **[Easy Cross-Platform File Mapping with a Single-Header C Library](https://github.com/dezashibi-c-projects/dmmap)**: A simple and efficient single-header C library for memory-mapped file access, supporting Windows, Linux, and macOS through a unified interface.
  2. **[Project Name 1](link-to-project-1)**: Brief description of what this project entails.
  3. **[Project Name 1](link-to-project-1)**: Brief description of what this project entails.

**TODO: THIS LIST WILL BE UPDATED SOON**
