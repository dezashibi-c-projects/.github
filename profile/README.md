# C Projects by [@dezashibi](https://github.com/dezashibi) (Navid Dezashibi)

Welcome to **dezashibi-c-projects**! This organization is dedicated to showcasing my skills in C programming and serving as an educational resource for those interested in learning C.

## About

I am Navid Dezashibi, a passionate C programmer. This organization contains a collection of my C projects, demonstrating a range of programming concepts, from basic syntax to advanced algorithms and data structures. Each project is well-documented and includes examples and explanations to aid understanding.

## Objectives

- **Skill Demonstration**: Highlight my proficiency in C programming through various projects. Also demonstrations of repository management, problem solving, patches, etc by simulating real-life situations. Most of these also have been reflected in the readme files of the repos to show knowledge management and keeping lesson learned materials.
- **Educational Resource**: Provide a comprehensive code base for beginners and enthusiasts to learn and reference.
- **Collaboration**: Encourage contributions and collaboration from other C developers and learners.

## Projects

### Naming Conventions
- `b-...` means the project demonstrates beginner friendly concepts, the goal is to use most aspect of `C` programming as much as possible.
- `i-...` means the project demonstrates intermediate level of programming, might be a toy project or just code examples, these codes are mostly focused on algorithms.
- `a-...` means the project is an advanced topic, might be a fully working project or just some code examples.
- `rc-...` means the project is meant to be for recreational demonstration.
- `m-...` means the project is mixture of everything that cannot be included in the categories above.
- `<no-prefix>-...` projects without prefixes are personal projects and code bases that I might work on for the sake of creativity and code exercising.
